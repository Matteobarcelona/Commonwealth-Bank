## Objective
Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity Job Simulation on Forage - September 2024
Completed a job simulation involving the role of a cybersecurity generalist, specializing in fraud detection and prevention for Commonwealth Bank's Cybersecurity team.
Developed skills in building data visualization dashboards using Splunk to uncover patterns and insights in historical customer data, aiding in fraud detection.
Demonstrated the ability to respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents, including notifying relevant teams, collecting information, containing and stopping attacks, and aiding in recovery efforts.
Enhanced security awareness expertise by designing infographics promoting best practices for secure password management, following Australian Cybersecurity Centre advice.
Acquired practical experience in penetration testing, assessing the security of web applications, identifying vulnerabilities, and providing recommendations for remediation to bolster cybersecurity defenses.

## Task 1 Data analysis:

Analyse and visualise cyber data to uncover trends and patterns:
* Gain hands-on experience in data analysis, especially in the context of cyber data.
* Understand the importance of data visualization in uncovering trends and patterns.
* Learn to use Splunk, a data analysis tool, for creating dashboards and visual representations of data.
* Develop skills in interpreting data fields and identifying key insights.

### Practice :

* Install and set up Splunk Enterprise, import the provided dataset and explore it using Splunk.
* Create a comprehensive dashboard with charts and tables to visualize fraud-related data for submission.

## Skills:
Password security, Splunk basics, Penetration testing, Detection and Response, Triage, Data visualisation 
 

## Take away:

I recently participated in Commonwealth Bank's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Cybersecurity team at Commonwealth Bank.
I worked on a project to uncover and exploit web application weaknesses via a comprehensive penetration testing report. I practiced using HackThisSite and built my penetration testing skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on mitigating and responding to cyber incidents, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Cybersecurity team at a company like Commonwealth Bank.
